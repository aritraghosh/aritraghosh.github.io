After a long wait(4 years), I was able to muster courage and enthusiasm on something that has pestered me all the way from high school. This is in no way to say that I have succeeded but I have gone a long way from what it used to be. Life has gone a full circle. I was 67 kg when I joined and looked just bit healthier than average, things exacerbated over time and somehow from last semester, I took a resolution to work on getting thin. Here, I write about some of the things that have helped me reduce weight. This is specific to me and some of the points are contentious. I am far from being fit and have taken only a step forward in the path of getting there.

</div>

As you can see, the change is **not** so drastic. Although the weight loss has been significant considerable(around 13 kg in period of 5 months), the change in physique has been less obvious.





## What worked for me

____

+ Drink *lukewarm* lemon water with tea-spoon of honey in the early morning.
+ Drink hot/lukewarm water through the day and try to drink atleast 4-5 liters of water through the day.
+ Avoid *sugary* food(of any kind including health drinks etc) and switch to having more vegetables and fruits which have lot of fibre. Eat more protein.
+ *Exercise* everyday for atleast 1/2-1 hour(Gym,Running, Swimming are great options)
+ Take small portions at regular intervals rather than fasting.
+ Avoid eating outside as much as possible especially oily food.



#### Small things that also help
+ Use the staircase rather than the elevator wherever possible.
+ Do not eat anything other than at meal times.
+ Take to eating  fruit instead of fruit juices.
+ Maintain a record of weight to have an idea of progress. Do not get swayed or bogged down by this but maintaining a record helps. Set achievable goals and ensure that you are able to fulfil them.
+ Avoid eating a  heavy meal at night. 


Last but not the least, dont get too obsessed if you are not able to reduce weight fast. It takes time. I will keep adding more as and when I find something useful and helpful.
