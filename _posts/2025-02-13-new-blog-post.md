I always found Netflix as an interesting company.From the compensation strategy, Keeper test and their top notch engineering culture, I find a lot of intriguiging things floating around. This is a somewhat incoherent rant on things I have been thinking about 

## Why stick to subscription only
Now, there are a lot of good reasons why as a customer I dont want to pay further for more content (Don't get me started on the sprawl of subscriptions and the number of companies in the subscription management space). But as a company, I dont see a good reason why I would want to cap my revenue.

Service Adressable Market (back of the napkin math)
- Global Population Base (2024): ~   8 B people
- Potential household accounts: ~2 billion households (Average global household size: ~3.5 people)
- Internet penetration: ~65% of global population
- Income levels sufficient for streaming services: ~40% of internet users
- Potential for regional pricing: Average global ARPU of ~$12/month
- Maximum potential annual revenue: 2 billion × 65% (internet) × 40% (income capability) = ~520 million households × $12 × 12 months = $75 billion per year

For reference, Netflix had an annual revenue of $33B($32B from subscriptions) in 2023. This is little less than half of the TAM possible. While $75B is in no way an easy feat (very few companies have a market cap of $75B), it is a good thought exercise on how to grow the TAM.Netflix recently launched a subscription tier which has ads but it dilutes the value prop atleast for some people (Never forget the golden adage, Everything is an ad network). I think Netflix would benefit from other revenue streams in the future. Games and podcasts are two interesting areas for expansion. I suspect they will have to move to add-on pricing model in the future. 

## Social networking aspects
Most of us hear about the Netflix challenge and its  role in the recommendation engine that Netflix pioneered. While it implictly recommends shows based on similar shows, some of us watch shows because our real life friends watched them. We all discuss popular shows in forums like Facebook, Reddit. I would be curious to explore if having an feed, friend list and more of the social network vibe to Netflix. I am surprised we dont have a tiktok like feed today in Netflix which then links to the entire show. Infact, I would love to be able to comment on specific scenes in the show and be able to view other's comments(starting with friends). The whole idea is not something unique but I think this will massively improve engagement for Netflix.
