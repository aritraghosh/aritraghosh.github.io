        <h1>Some tips for Weight loss</h1>
<p class="meta">05 Feb 2016</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>After a long wait(4 years), I was able to muster courage and enthusiasm on something that has pestered me all the way from high school. This is in no way to say that I have succeeded but I have gone a long way from what it used to be. Life has gone a full circle. I was 67 kg when I joined and looked just bit healthier than average, things exacerbated over time and somehow from last semester, I took a resolution to work on getting thin. Here, I write about some of the things that have helped me reduce weight. This is specific to me and some of the points are contentious. I am far from being fit and have taken only a step forward in the path of getting there.</p>

<div style="width:1100px; margin:0 auto;">

<img src="https://aritraghosh.github.io/images/Aritra_new.jpg" alt="Now" style="align: right;width: 400px;  height: 711px;" />
</div>

<p>As you can see, the change is <strong>not</strong> so drastic. Although the weight loss has been significant considerable(around 19 kg in period of 6 months), the change in physique has been less obvious.</p>

<h2 id="what-worked-for-me">What worked for me</h2>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Drink <em>lukewarm</em> lemon water with tea-spoon of honey in the early morning.</li>
  <li>Drink hot/lukewarm water through the day and try to drink atleast 4-5 liters of water through the day.</li>
  <li>Avoid <em>sugary</em> food(of any kind including health drinks etc) and switch to having more vegetables and fruits which have lot of fibre. Eat more protein.</li>
  <li><em>Exercise</em> everyday for atleast 1/2-1 hour(Gym,Running, Swimming are great options)</li>
  <li>Take small portions at regular intervals rather than fasting.</li>
  <li>Avoid eating outside as much as possible especially oily food.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="small-things-that-also-help">Small things that also help</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Use the staircase rather than the elevator wherever possible.</li>
  <li>Do not eat anything other than at meal times.</li>
  <li>Take to eating  fruit instead of fruit juices.</li>
  <li>Maintain a record of weight to have an idea of progress. Do not get swayed or bogged down by this but maintaining a record helps. Set achievable goals and ensure that you are able to fulfil them.</li>
  <li>Avoid eating a  heavy meal at night.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not the least, dont get too obsessed if you are not able to reduce weight fast. It takes time. I will keep adding more as and when I find something useful and helpful.</p>
