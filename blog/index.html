	My blog story is a little complicated! I write most of my technical articles in Medium, some more general ones on Substack and my rants are here.
All of these are my personal opinions and do not represent my employer in the past, present or future. You are welcome to read and provide feedback but no furhter!
	<ul class="posts">

	  {% for post in site.posts %}
	    <li><span>{{ post.date | date_to_string }}</span> Â» <a href="{{ post.url }}" title="{{ post.title }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
	  {% endfor %}
	</ul>
